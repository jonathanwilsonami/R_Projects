Recall hypothesis testing for a proportion from STAT 121.  Provide a
definition for the function below to compute the z test statistic testing the
null hypothesis that the proportion is p0 (which is 0.5 by default) given the
numbers of successes and trials.

```{r}
#Not sure if this is the right formula. I just found this in my Stat 201 book and tried it on 
#an example and it worked just fine. 
prop.test <- function(n.success,n.trials,p0=0.5){
  pHat <- n.success / n.trials
  top <- pHat - p0 
  bottom <- sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n.trials)
  Z <- top / bottom 
  return(Z)
}
  
```
